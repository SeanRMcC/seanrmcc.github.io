            <div class="text">A web application written in the dotnet framework allowing users to discover restaurants locally or at a specified location. Restaurants are chosen in a "king of the hill" fashion, where they are pitted up one by one. Munch scrapes the web for the reservation and take out links for the "winning" restaurant, then allowing users to directly add a time to visit the restaurant to their google calendar.</div>

            <div class="text">Developed at HackHarvard 2023 in a team of 3 developers, FitFusion uses the TerraAPI to integrate with a myriad of different wearables (i.e. Apple Watch, Fit Bit, Garmin). FitFusion gamifies exercise, tracking the user's resting heart rate and either adding or deducting points. A global leader board is kept, where you can challenge your friends and see who can get the most points!</div>
