            <div class="text">CS 460 Teaching Assistant</div>
            <div class="text">Currently, I am employed as a teaching assistant—the step above a course assistant at Boston University—for CS 460 - Introduction to Database Systems. This class tries to cover the topic of databases in breadth, first discussing how to logically model data, then transitions to the relational model and SQL. We then learn about what happens under the hood with data storage and concurrency control. After that, we touch on noSQL and distributed databases. As a teaching assistant, I had all of the responsibilities of a course assistant along with hosting two 50 minute discussion sessions where I went over practice problems and answered questions.</div>

            <div class="text">CS 112 Course Assistant</div>
            <div class="text">Over the course of two semesters, I had the privilege of working as a member of the course staff of CS 112 - Introduction to Computer Science 2. This class was taught in Java, and was student's first exposure to the language and statically typed languages in general. As a course assistant, I had weekly office hours where I helped students one on one with content, homework, and studying for exams. I also had to grade weekly problem sets and proctor exams.</div>
